1. How is Hashmap implemented, time complexities, details about how hash function works.
2. What is a BST, what is the time complexities 
3. What algorithm you use to convert a BST that has only right children (sorted array)
4. Challenging work you have done in past. 
5. Merge sort vs Quick sort, about their time complexities, which is preferable when sorting a large data set.
